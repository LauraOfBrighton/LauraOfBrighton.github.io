      <h2>Why bother? </h2>

      <p><span class="highlight">Video is a great value marketing tool for your business</span> - with 73% of B2B marketers saying that video positively impacts marketing ROI (<a href="http://www.reelseo.com/b2b-marketers-video-roi" target="_blank">Source</a>). A smart marketer takes advantage of video as a tool to promote their brand or product, with 64% expecting video to dominate their strategies in the near future (<a href="http://www.brafton.com/news/survey-says-marketers-increase-social-video-content-budgets" target="_blank">Nielsen</a>). </p>

      <p><span class="highlight">We live in a world that is becoming more video orientated</span> - By 2017 video will account for 69% of consumer traffic (<a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/ip-ngn-ip-next-generation-network/white_paper_c11-481360.html" target="_blank">Cisco</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Your competitors already are using video</span> - Various studies show that over half of companies are already using the video so if you are not then you are already falling behind (<a href="https://www.axonn.media/content-marketing/latest-trends/content-marketing-trends-in-2013" target="_blank">Axonn</a>). 71% of companies plan to increase video marketing budget - because it works! (<a href="http://www.reelseo.com/increase-video-marketing-spend" target="_blank">Source</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Outsource for ease and expertise</span> - There is a reason why 93% of companies outsource all or part of their video content creation; it is easier, may well be cheaper than using internal resources, plus it gives you access to expertise and equipment that you may not possess (ibid). 
      </p>

      <p>Having worked in sales and marketing for many years I can understand the challenges that you face when integrating video into your wider marketing and business strategy. It is my mission to understand your company and your needs, and to create videos that communicate your key messages clearly.

                  <!-- <h3>Case Study: Dabapps</h3>
      <p>
        High growth digital agency Dabapps wanted to show off how they have fostered excellent client relationships to create award winning apps for clients. A range of video testimonials were produced for the client for display online. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It had been difficult for Dabapps to complete video projects internally so using an external supplier to project manage and produce meant a weight off their marketing departments shoulders! I project managed the production process; including planning, securing an external venue, writing and conducting interviews, right through to editing, review and delivery.

        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Working with Laura to produce a number of client video testimonials has been a really positive experience. Laura guided us through the planning, filming and editing process and took every opportunity to understand our business and what we wanted to achieve. Our team and clients were impressed with her professionalism, quick turnaround and the quality of the videos she's produced. We look forward to working with her again soon!&#34;

                        <h3>Case Study: Bozboz</h3>
      <p>
        Bozboz are an exciting creative agency who were celebrating the opening of their new office and event space in Brighton with an art exhibition curated by renowned curator Eddie Loch and starring dynamic, urban artists such as Goldie, Banksy and Pam Glew. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        I filmed this event, interviewed attendees and edited a video that would promote the availability of this space and communicate the excitement around the launch. The Bozboz team provided examples of films covering similar events so I created the video in a similar style, as requested. 
      </p>
      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Laura is a true professional and great to work with - she's organised, methodical yet very creative and was able to quickly adapt to our ideas and effectively showcase the overall mission of our creative space. She threw herself into the project from the offset and I was very impressed by the level of communication and the way she quickly handled all feedback, making the process painless. The outcome is really great!&#34;

    <h3>Case Study: Active Sussex This Girl Can Campaign</h3>
      <p>
        Active Sussex are the County Sports Partnership of Sussex, tasked with increasing participation in sport and physical activity. They represent and manage Sport England&#39;s national This Girl Can campaign locally. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Active Sussex had recently recruited an Ambassador in Sussex to promote the campaign and wanted to produce inspiring video content showing the Ambassador trying new sports, with the aim of the campaign to encourage women of all shapes and sizes to try something new. This was a first time for presenter Tess so she was a little nervous but we had lots of fun filming this project. 
      <p>
        The case study below shows a short upbeat film that tells the story of Tess trying skateboarding with the UK number 1 female skateboarder Lucy Adams and Brighton group She Shredders. I used a main camera and a body camera on the presenter to really get a feel for the excitement of this challenging activity. 
      </p>
      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Videos can be very time consuming to produce, but Laura took the pain out of the process. She was professional from the start to the finish of the process. She accurately interpreted our brief and the look and feel that we were going for - we barely had any amends to feed back. Laura used her creativity and chose great music, to make the video young, fun and full of life. Once the video was ready to be published, she even offered to upload the video to our YouTube account and suggested key words to boost our SEO ranking. I would definitely recommend working with Laura.&#34;

      <h3>Case Study: How Dare She</h3>
      <p>
        How Dare She wanted a client testimonial video which showed what the consultancy provided, communicating the fun and theatricality of the brand, and covered the launch of a particular retail marketing campaign. Thorough planning and a calm and professional approach put the client at ease on what was understandably a busy day for them. I conducted the interview to get an enthusiastic testimonial and How Dare She was very pleased with the results.   
      </p>
      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Laura was amazing, very professional, reliable and a pleasure to work with. One of the most helpful things she included in her services was a detailed video brief for the day, outlining the structure and letting me know exactly what she needed me to do. I was so pleased with the final video she had created it had really captured the day and had a theatrical feel which fitted really well with the branding of my business. I would highly recommend Laura to any business that is thinking about using video as part of their marketing strategy.&#34;

    <h3>Case Study: Troy Bradley Osteopathy</h3>
      <p>
        Troy needed a video to promote his business which had recently moved location and  was undergoing a rebrand. I planned, produced and edited the following video. This was then uploaded to Youtube where I dealt with correcting channel settings and ensuring the video adhered to best SEO standards to improve chances of being found in search listings. I also gave Troy some general marketing advice &#45; all part of the service!
      </p>
      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;It was an absolute pleasure to work with Laura. Her knowledge and expertise in marketing is unprecedented. She has made such an impact on my business strategy and helped me no end; going above and beyond. She is professional and put me at ease very quickly during filming, guiding me throughout and producing a great final product. I would highly recommend her to anyone requiring her type of services. Regarding the video &#45; I love it! Thank you Laura, for everything.&#34;
