      <h2>Why bother? </h2>

      <p><span class="highlight">We live in a world that is becoming more video orientated</span> - By 2017 video will account for 69% of consumer traffic (<a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/ip-ngn-ip-next-generation-network/white_paper_c11-481360.html" target="_blank">Cisco stats</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="highlight">A smart marketer takes advantage of video as a tool to promote their brand or product</span> - 64% of marketers expect video to dominate their strategies in the near future (<a href="http://www.brafton.com/news/survey-says-marketers-increase-social-video-content-budgets" target="_blank">Nielsen stats</a>). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="highlight">Your competitors already are using video</span> - Various studies show that over half of companies are already using the video so if you are not then you are already falling behind (<a href="https://www.axonn.media/content-marketing/latest-trends/content-marketing-trends-in-2013" target="_blank">Axonn stats</a>).
      </p>

      <p>Having worked in sales and marketing for many years I can understand the challenges you face when integrating video into your wider marketing and business strategy. However, we can all appreciate the huge opportunity that video can provide for your company too.

    <h3>Case Study: Sussex Active This Girl Can Campaign</h3>
      <p>
        Active Sussex had recently recruited an Ambassador in Sussex to promote the This Girl Can campaing and wanted a video produced. This was a first time for presenter Tess so she was a little nervous but we had lots of fun filming this project. I used a main camera and a GoPro to create an upbeat short film to encourage women of all shapes and sizes to try out a new sport &#45; in this case skateboarding. I uploaded the video to social media, taking care of video SEO, and produced a short teaser. 
      </p>

        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Videos can be very time consuming to produce, but Laura took the pain out of the process. She was professional from the start to the finish of the process. She accurately interpreted our brief and the look and feel that we were going for - we barely had any amends to feed back. Laura used her creativity and chose great music, to make the video young, fun and full of life. Once the video was ready to be published, she even offered to upload the video to our YouTube account and suggested key words to boost our SEO ranking. I would definitely recommend working with Laura.&#34;

    <h3>Case Study: Troy Bradley Osteopathy</h3>
      <p>
        Troy needed a video to promote his business which had recently moved location and  was undergoing a rebrand. I planned, produced and edited the following video. This was then uploaded to Youtube where I dealt with correcting channel settings and ensuring the video adhered to best SEO standards to improve chances of being found in search listings. I also gave Troy some general marketing advice &#45; all part of the service!
      </p>
      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;It was an absolute pleasure to work with Laura. Her knowledge and expertise in marketing is unprecedented. She has made such an impact on my business strategy and helped me no end; going above and beyond. She is professional and put me at ease very quickly during filming, guiding me throughout and producing a great final product. I would highly recommend her to anyone requiring her type of services. Regarding the video &#45; I love it! Thank you Laura, for everything.&#34;

                  <h3>Case Study: The Sidewinder Pub</h3>
      <p>
        Firstly, I produced a series of video content for the Sidewinder; showing viewers how to make some of the delicious cocktails served at the pub and encourage them to come along to enjoy the friendly atmosphere there. Secondly, a video promoting the Sidewinder as a venue for Christmas parties was made to promote bookings. Again, this was all uploaded with SEO and general Youtube settings taken care of and a sprinkling of marketing advice.

        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Working with Laura to produce content for our social media presence has been a blast. She brings creative ideas to the table and backs them up with the practical knowledge that we definitely lack! All those details about how to make the most of YouTube etc were totally handled, and Laura was immensely easy to work with, delivering great videos with a quick turnaround. We'll definitely be working with her again in future.&#34;
