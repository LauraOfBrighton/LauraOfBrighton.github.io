        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Working with Laura to produce a number of client video testimonials has been a really positive experience. Laura guided us through the planning, filming and editing process and took every opportunity to understand our business and what we wanted to achieve. Our team and clients were impressed with her professionalism, quick turnaround and the quality of the videos she's produced. We look forward to working with her again soon!&#34;

       <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Laura is a true professional and great to work with - she's organised, methodical yet very creative and was able to quickly adapt to our ideas and effectively showcase the overall mission of our creative space. She threw herself into the project from the offset and I was very impressed by the level of communication and the way she quickly handled all feedback, making the process painless. The outcome is really great!&#34;

      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Videos can be very time consuming to produce, but Laura took the pain out of the process. She was professional from the start to the finish of the process. She accurately interpreted our brief and the look and feel that we were going for - we barely had any amends to feed back. Laura used her creativity and chose great music, to make the video young, fun and full of life. Once the video was ready to be published, she even offered to upload the video to our YouTube account and suggested key words to boost our SEO ranking. I would definitely recommend working with Laura.&#34;
          </i>
        </h4>
        <p><small>- Joanna Savage, PR &amp; Comms, Active Sussex</small></p>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Laura was amazing, very professional, reliable and a pleasure to work with. One of the most helpful things she included in her services was a detailed video brief for the day, outlining the structure and letting me know exactly what she needed me to do. I was so pleased with the final video she had created it had really captured the day and had a theatrical feel which fitted really well with the branding of my business. I would highly recommend Laura to any business that is thinking about using video as part of their marketing strategy.&#34;

          <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;It was an absolute pleasure to work with Laura. Her knowledge and expertise in marketing is unprecedented. She has made such an impact on my business strategy and helped me no end; going above and beyond. She is professional and put me at ease very quickly during filming, guiding me throughout and producing a great final product. I would highly recommend her to anyone requiring her type of services. Regarding the video &#45; I love it! Thank you Laura, for everything.&#34;

          <div class="testimonial">
        <h4>
          <i>&#34;Working with Laura to produce content for our social media presence has been a blast. She brings creative ideas to the table and backs them up with the practical knowledge that we definitely lack! All those details about how to make the most of YouTube etc were totally handled, and Laura was immensely easy to work with, delivering great videos with a quick turnaround. We'll definitely be working with her again in future.&#34;
